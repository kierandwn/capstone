# propagate

P##LACEHOLDER, WIP. CPP.
## capstone 

Low Mars Orbit (LMO) propagator written in the completion of the final dynamics capstone mission of the Spacecraft Dynamics & Control specialisation (University of Colorado, Coursera).

Key Features:
 - Propagation in time implemented as 4th Order Runge-Kutta integration.
 - Proportional-Derivative (PD) control implementation on Modified Rodriguez Parameter (MRP) attitude representation. More control schemes to come.

Developments to come:
 - More control schemes & time interation solvers available, configurable.
 - Sensor models & Kalman estimation in-the-loop.
